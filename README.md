Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, building and maintaining software. 
It is important in the technology industry as it enables the development of creative software that is used in different sectors in the industry. It also ensures smooth running of software by testing, reviewing and maintaining the programs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages such as Vue.js, TypeScript, etc.
Development of frameworks such as django, Laravel, enabling the use of re-usable components and development of full stack applications.
Introduction of web development technologies such as Html, CSS and JavaScript, which enabled the creation of dynamic and interactive websites.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-In this phase the system requirements and user wants are gathered.
Design-Detailed designs of the software to be created are developed.
Implementation- Includes writing code and building the software.
Testing- Tests are generated and run.
Deployment-the developed software is released to the users.
Maintainance- an ongoing process of providing support and updates for the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall folows a linear and sequential approach while Agile follows a iterative and incremental approach. In Waterfall there is low flexibilty as changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed, while Agile is very felxible as changes can be implemented throughout the development phases.
Waterfall would be ideal for long term projects with clearly defined requirements. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software Developer writes the code for software.
A Quality Assurance Engineer checks whether code written meets quality standards.
A Project Manager oversees the software project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: Examples include Visual Studio code, cursor, windsurf
VCS: GitHub


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing:The testing of individual components.
Integration testing: Testing of how components interact with each other.
System testing: Testing of the system as a whole.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting clear, specific and concise prompts to get the best possible responses from AI.
It helps the AI to understand the users' request better.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: "Teach me about the Lamborghini."
Improved prompt: "Provide an overview of the Lamborghini including its history, key features, brand types and models."
 The improved prompt is more effective as it specified the aspects the user wants to know, that is the car's hostory, key features, brand types and models.
